## The problem....

![](the_problem.png)

No such file?? Is the app code wrong? Or is the file missing?

## Code looks good to me

## Is the file there??

![](dir_structure.png)

Yup! Sure looks like it!!

## What's next?

We've ruled out that the issue is with the app code and the datafile is in the same directory as the application file.

-   Is it the environment? Maybe?

-   We should publish this app somewhere else to check?

-   But where? Are there other Posit products to publish to??

## What was the cause of the original failure?

Some theories:

-   There was a deployment to staging when the error occurred.

    -   But after discussing with the engineering team, a deployment shouldn't have caused the failure.

-   So it's still TBD, but the content is now in our automated publishing tests.

## The lesson we learned...

-   Posit products are starting to have overlapping features
-   This means it's another tool to help debug issues
