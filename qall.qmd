## The problem....

![](the_problem.png)

No such file?? The app code should be correct and the file is there, but let's verify.

## Code looks good to me

Disclaimer: I didn't write the app code but it looks good to me??

## Is the file there??

Yup! Sure looks like it!!

## What's next?

We've ruled out that the issue is with the app code and the datafile is in the same directory as the application file.

-   Is it the environment? Maybe?

-   We should publish this app somewhere else to check?

-   But where? Are there other Posit products to publish to??
